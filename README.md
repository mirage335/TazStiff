Portable, high-speed, low-cost advanced multi-tool desktop factory derived from LulzBot Taz and TazMega.

Intended to simultaneously operate multiple at least milling, laser, extrusion (FDM 3D Printing), and inkjet (powder 3D printing, 2D coloring) tools. MightyTool mounting hardware should be installed.

#Tweaks
Z-Axis motor mounting plate edges protrude into the frame extrusions, and must be ground slightly to compensate.

Spacer blocks may not leave adequate clearance for the most ideal gantry plate screw locations. Solvable with moderate grinding.

Lock nuts used in wheel assemblies may conflict with some metal plates. Moderate grinding, or use of jam nuts with threadlocker, are solutions.

Deck screws should be put right through the joints between frame and Y-axis.

#FutureWork
* Double bottom extrusions, providing much of the rigidity of a mechanical table.
* Move motor out from under Y-axis assembly, for better use of vertical space.

#Copyright Extensions
Files embedded into the design by mirage335 with a less restrictive license than GPLv3 place any derrived works under that license. This is definied to include any files pulled into the repository by mirage335 .
